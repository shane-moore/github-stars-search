# Getting Started with GitHub Stars Search

GitHub Stars Search can be used to search for a GitHub user via the GitHub REST API and be returned links to all of their repositories ranked by stars in descending order.

The production app is hosted via Netlify at https://github-stars-search.netlify.app/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed

## Deployment

This app has been deployed to https://github-stars-search.netlify.app/ using Netlify CLI.
